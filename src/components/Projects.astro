        For over a year now I have been part of an almost 20 person team of
        fellow Tufts students developing "FreeBites", a mobile app for
        discovering and posting free food, combating food insecurity and waste.
        I joined the team several months before release to help prepare for
        launch, delivering consistent new features and fixes. After release I
        have continued to work on new app features, devops, and the company's
        web landing page.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since the app released in October 2024, we have accumulated over 1000 downloads
        from within the Tufts community and continued to deliver consistent post-launch
        updates. Looking forward, we have begun work on scaling the app to have it
        ready to expand to other universities and institutions, as well as fundraising
        to cover development costs.

        This project is a collaboration with UC Berkeley's Colaboratory for
        Equity in Water Allocation (COEQWAL) to develop an accessible data
        visualization tool to help the general public better understand water
        allocation challenges in California.
        <br />
        <br />
        California has extensive water infrastructure, however due to its dry climate
        and intermittent rainfall it can be very difficult to consistently meet all
        of the state's water demands. Unfortunately, the decision-making process
        behind these water management choices is not very clear to the average person.
        COEQWAL is attempting to increase transparency and awareness around these
        issues by providing people with the data and resources to understand potential
        water management futures.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website I am creating serves as a companion to the core project, providing
        a simplified visualization of real data that abstracts away some of the more
        confusing elements to provide a "first step" into understanding California's
        many water management challenges. The site is still in development with a
        completed functional prototype in the repository below.

        In addition to programming, one of the things I am most passionate about
        is music. I create and release my own ambient electronic music, and I
        wanted to have a website where I could archive everything I've created,
        and a platform for some web based audio experiences. With this goal, I
        created formerly.me, a living website that is constantly expanding with
        new features and sub-projects.<br />
        <br />
        The site contains a mix of interactive ways to learn more about my released
        music, as well as several endlessly generating algorithmic music compositions
        like "Macrobiome" and "Tone Garden" built with TypeScript and the Web Audio
        API.

        PeakSynth is an open source audio plugin I built using C++ and the JUCE
        framework, capable of interfacing with any Digital Audio Workstation
        software. The plugin takes ambient noise and live MIDI input, melding
        them into a harmonic mix of tonal and textural sounds. You can find a
        longer description with some audio demos at the repository linked below.

        A project I built for the Tufts JumboHack 2025 Hackathon along with four
        other developers and a designer. We wanted to make a web development
        teaching tool dedicated to learning Tailwind, since we had all felt that
        there were not too many resources for this when we were trying to first
        learn the framework. <br />

          >"Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow, And Blue"</a
        >, we wanted to create a set of educational Tailwind challenges centered
        around recreating famous abstract artworks, each teaching the user about
        how to invoke key CSS properties like flexbox, grid, and border radius
        in Tailwind. The website uses a live code editor for the user to get
        instant visual feedback on their work and an image difference checker
        for seeing how well they were able to match the original paintings.
